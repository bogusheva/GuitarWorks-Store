# Guitarworks

It's my Capstone Project after studying JavaScript block at Frontend Development Course at Beetroot Academy. My first store site is made with Vanilla JavaScript using a responsive design. It has few pages: home, catalog and news. Catalog let sort products in different ways, make buy/notify order. This web application uses Unsplash Image API and Swiper slider to display images.
