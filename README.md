# Guitarworks

It's my Capstone Project after studying JavaScript block in Frontend Development Course at Beetroot Academy. My first store site is made with Vanilla JavaScript using a responsive design. It has a few pages: home, catalogue and news. The catalogue lets sort products in different ways, and make buy/notify orders. This web application uses Unsplash Image API and Swiper slider to display images.
