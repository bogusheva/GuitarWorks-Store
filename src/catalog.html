The Standard Plus uses some of the most common appointments of custom built Suhr Standards. These guitars are light, toneful and perfectly balanced. Utilizing a Basswood body and Maple top, a fat, well-balanced tone can be achieved that produces smooth sounds without any harsh overtones. The finishing process provides an unparalleled combination of protection and beauty, while the thinnest possible coats of finish are applied to allow the wood to resonate freely and still provide ample protection.
