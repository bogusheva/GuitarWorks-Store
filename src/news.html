          text: `One of the highlights of the NAMM Show every year is the Fender Custom Shop event.  Several hundred guitars are built specifically to be shown at the event, with many of those being one offs, only available at NAMM.  Eligible Custom Shop dealers browse around and put their cards in the guitars they are interested in and at the end of the night Fender puts all the cards from each guitar into a bin and randomly selects the dealer that gets to order each guitar.  This year our card was drawn 6 times, and rumour has it there may be a 7th on the way.

Check out all our little lotto winners here and have a look at a few of the guitars on NAMM night below.`,

The Monkey Lord has garnered a huge online following thanks to his energetic demeanor and killer playing.  In 2009, he used that online following to help launch Chapman Guitars with the goal of crowdsourcing feedback to help design guitars that players really wanted, while offering great value.  We were proud to become the first Canadian dealer for Chapman Guitars in 2014 and continue to provide Canada with the largest selection of Chapman in the country.  We are so excited for the new models they have just announced, and more that will be announced soon.  We've just put an order in and made all models available for preorder.
